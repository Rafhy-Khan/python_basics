Python Assignment#01 – Core Concepts & Practice
Repository Overview

This repository contains a Python basics notebook created to revise and strengthen fundamental Python programming concepts.
It is designed for beginners and students who want to build a strong foundation in Python syntax, data types, and basic input handling before moving to advanced topics like Machine Learning and AI.

Topics Covered

This notebook explains Python fundamentals with clear definitions and practical examples, including:

Variables

What a variable is in Python

How variables store values in memory

Rules and best practices for naming variables

Python Data Types

The following core data types are explained with examples:

Integer (int) – whole numbers

Float (float) – decimal numbers

String (str) – text data

Boolean (bool) – True and False values

Input Function

Using the input() function to take user input

Understanding that input is stored as a string by default

Type Function

Using the type() function to check the data type of a variable

Type Casting

Converting data types using:

int()

float()

str()

Practice Program

A simple Python program that:

Takes a number as input from the user

Displays the data type of the entered value

This program helps reinforce concepts of input handling, type checking, and type conversion.
